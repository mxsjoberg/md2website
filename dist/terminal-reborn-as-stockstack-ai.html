<p><em>July 2023</em></p>
<p>I recently re-launched Terminal as Stockstack.AI, available here: <a href="https://stockstack.ai">stockstack.ai</a>. I might change domain again since nothing seems to beat .com, so sorry in advance! If you can't stand the .AI hype, it's also available here: <a href="https://www.trystockstack.com/">trystockstack.com</a>.</p>
<p>Stockstack.AI is a slimmed down version of Terminal with a more narrow focus on distraction-free stock market data. The goal is to beat Yahoo Finance in data coverage and user experience. To hone in on this goal (and to reduce workload!), I removed several features, including portfolio tracker, batch requests, and query.</p>
<p>The updated version shipped with an improved grid for organizing data widgets. Widgets now have scalable text, support multiple columns (great for financials), and are freely resizable and movable around the workspace.</p>
<p>I also updated most data in widgets and added several new sources. If you add your own API key for Seeking Alpha (requires an active subscription), you can basically have five different news widgets, which should be more than enough to give a fairly comprehensive 
overview of the market.</p>
<p>Other new and interesting widgets show interest rates by various institutions, market status, upcoming holidays, and company filings (both today and historical for ticker). The old chart widget is replace by four widgets with charts for different ranges, so can view all at same time.</p>
<p>There's an AI-assistant widget, obviously. It's not as good or fast as looking at data widgets for pricing data, but great for providing wikipedia-style information about less known companies or CEOs.</p>
<p>Here's a few example responses:</p>
<blockquote>

They are best known for creating iconic game franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter. In addition to developing and publishing games, Capcom also operates amusement arcades in Japan. Here's an unexpected trivia about Capcom: Did you know that the company's name, "Capcom," is an abbreviation of "Capsule Computers"? This name was chosen to reflect the company's focus on creating innovative games that are like capsules filled with fun and excitement.</p>

<p>Pricing starts at USD 10.00, but will increase to USD 29.00 in a few weeks. I am still thinking about adding a proper free plan.</p></div><div id='footer'><p>[<a id='invert'>light|dark</a>]</p><p class='small'>DOM loaded in <span id='dom_time'></span>, page loaded in <span id='load_time'></span>. <a href='https://github.com/mixmaester/md2html'>Static website built with md2html</a></p></div><script>hljs.highlightAll();</script></body></html>
